Hello! I am a recent graduate of Brown University, where I studied Applied Math and Computer Science. I am broadly interested in theoretical and applied cryptography. 

During my time at Brown, I was fortunate to work with <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~seny/">Seny Kamara</a> on multiple projects dealing with leakage attacks, searchable databases, and MPC, as well as <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/eupfal/">Eli Upfal</a> on weakly supervised learning.
