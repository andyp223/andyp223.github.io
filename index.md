Hello! I am a recent graduate of Brown University, where I studied Applied Math and Computer Science. I am currently interested in applied cryptography.

During my time at Brown, I was fortunate to work with Seny Kamara on multiple projects dealing with leakage attacks and searchable databases, and Eli Upfal on weakly supervised learning. 

I am applying to PhD programs for Fall 2021. 

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Federated Learning
- Encrypted Databases
- Secure Multi-Party Computation
